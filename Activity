1.Write a program that generates a stream of random numbers and writes them to a file.



import random

with open('Random_numbers.txt','w') as a:

  for i in range(20):

    Random_number = random.randint(1, 100)

    a.write(str(Random_number) + '\n')



     

2.Write a program to read the random numbers from the file created above and calculate their average.





import random

with open('Random_numbers.txt', 'r') as a:

    numbers = [float(line.strip()) for line in a]

average = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

print(f'Average of random numbers:{average}')

     

3.Write a program that reads from a file and handles the case where the file does not exist.





name=input("Enter the file name:")

try:

  with open(name, 'r') as a:

    print("File content:",a.read())

except FileNotFoundError:

  print(f"The file '{name}' does not exist.")





     

4.Create a user-defined exception NegativeNumberError that is raised when a negative number is encountered in a list.





try:

    list1 = [1, 2, -3 , 4, 5]

    for i in list1:

        if i<0:

            raise ValueError("Negative number encountered")

    print("All numbers are non-negative.")

except ValueError as e:

    print(e)



     



5.Create a NumPy array of 10 random numbers and print them.





import random

import numpy as np

a=np.random.randint(0,50,size=10)

print(a)



     

6.Write a program to add and remove items from a NumPy array.





import numpy as np

a=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

print("original array is:",np.array(a))

b=np.append(a,10)

print(b)

print(np.delete(b,4))



     

7.Sort the NumPy array which you created.





a=[34,23,89,56,45,76,6]

print("original array is:",np.array(a))

a.sort()

print(a)



     

8.Reshape a NumPy array into a 2x5 matrix.





import numpy as np

a=[90,26,4,89,34,67,23,56,76,43]

b=np.array(a)

c=b.reshape(2,5)

print(c)



     

9.Demonstrate indexing and slicing on the reshaped matrix.





import numpy as np

a=[90,26,4,89,34,67,23,56,76,43]

b=np.array(a)

c=b.reshape(2,5)

print(c)

print(c[1,3])

print(c[0,1:4])



     







10.Write a program to append new data to an existing file and then read the updated file.





with open('data.txt', 'a') as f:

  f.write('\nWelcome to python class.')

with open('data.txt', 'r') as f:

  for line in f:

    print(line.strip())
